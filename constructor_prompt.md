Read through the project_setup.md file in the root of this directory and run it as a prompt, but make sure to consider the additional instructions below

<additional_instructions>

Before you start implementing, make sure to make a comprehensive plan inside <planning> tags where you break down the implementation to meaningful steps, that can be independently verified. Create each step inside <implementation_step_x> tags, where x is the step number.

Inside each implementation, write a set of acceptance tests inside <acceptance_tests> tags. These tests must be run and passe before you continue with the next step.

Write your implementation plan to a file called project_implementation.md in the root directory. Make sure to update it if you make adjustments to the plan as you go along

Once you are done planning, go ahead an start the implementation. Make sure that all acceptance tests are passed before moving on to the next step.

Make sure to execute the commands to run the project and use browser_tools to verify that everything works

Make sure to fix any issues you discover, so your final delivery is a fully working project

If you at any point get stuck and require user input before being able to continue, then pause the implementation and provide a clear explanation of what the user needs to do to get you unstuck

At the end of the implementation make sure to clean up any directories and files that you generated only for the impplementation and that are not used for the project going forward
